# Simple Trigonometry Library
 This is a simple library for calculating the approximate values of trigonometric functions with any given angle.
 The code might not the best approach, i wrote it for fun and improving my coding skills.
## Referecene
I used Taylor series for calculating the sine and cosine functions. Other functions can be found with these two.

$sinx = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{n}x^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!}$

$cosx = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{n}x^{2n}}{(2n)!}$
